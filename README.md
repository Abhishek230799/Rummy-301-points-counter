Rummy 301 Points Counter Tired of scribbling down scores every time we played Rummy 301, I decided to build a simple Java Swing app to keep track of points automatically. Just enter player names, add rounds, and watch the app handle the rest â€” eliminating players who hit 301 and crowning the last one standing. Easy, fun, and saves paper!
